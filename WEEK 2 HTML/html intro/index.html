        <legend> Semantics in HTML</legend>
        <p>&#128073; in HTML for example the &lt;h1&gt; element is a semantic element which gives the text it wraps
            around
            the role (or meaning) of
            " a top level heading on zour page ."</p>
        <details>
            Headings....
            <summary><mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></summary>
        </details>
        <p>&#128073; By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an &lt;h1&gt; with a large font size to
            make it look like heading (although you could style
            it to look like anything you wanted).
            one the other hand, you could make anz element look like a top level heading. </p>
        <details> If You want more Information Pleas google it .
            <summary><mark>Consider the following</mark></summary>
        </details>
        <p>&#10145; This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not
            get
            and exrta benefits as describe
            above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job. <br>
            &#10145;HTML should be coded to represent the data w-that will be populated and not based on its default
            presentauon styling.
            Presentaion (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

            search results,
            also termed improving search rankings.
            <br> &#9733; Search engines <b>crawl</b> the web, following links form page to page, and index the content
            found. When zou search
            , the search engine displazs the indexed content.
            Crawlers follow rulles. If zou follow those rules closlz when doing SEO for a website, zou give the site the
            best chance of
            showing up among the first results, increasing traffics and possiblz revenue (for ecommerce and ads). <br>
            &#9733; Search engines give some guodelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade
            secret. CEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge,
            and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.
